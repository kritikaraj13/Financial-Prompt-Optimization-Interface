    "##  Dataset Creation for Financial Prompt Optimization Interface Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Dataset Was Created:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was generated using Python, leveraging the `random` and `csv` modules. The core idea was to define various categories of financial queries and then programmatically generate a multitude of variations within each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the creation process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Defining Core Entities and Categories:**\n",
    "    * **Companies and Tickers:** A list of major US-based public companies and their stock tickers (e.g., Apple, AAPL) was established to ensure real-world relevance.\n",
    "    * **Timeframes:** Common time references used in financial reporting (e.g., \"last quarter,\" \"2023,\" \"this year\") were defined.\n",
    "    * **Financial Terms:** A vocabulary of financial analysis terms (e.g., \"performance,\" \"outlook,\" \"valuation\") was curated to add variation to queries.\n",
    "    * **Fixed Income Instruments:** Various types of fixed income securities (e.g., \"corporate bonds,\" \"Treasury notes\") were included for a specialized category.\n",
    "    * **Market Sectors:** Key market sectors (e.g., \"technology,\" \"healthcare,\" \"financial\") were listed to facilitate sector-specific queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Intent-Specific Query Generation Functions:**\n",
    "    * **`generate_stock_queries()`:** Focuses on queries related to individual company stock analysis (e.g., \"Analyze Apple stock performance,\" \"AAPL stock forecast\"). It combines companies, timeframes, and financial terms to create diverse phrases.\n",
    "    * **`generate_quarterly_queries()`:** Generates queries specifically asking for information about company quarterly or annual financial reports (e.g., \"Summary of Microsoft's Q1 report,\" \"Key metrics from GOOGL's latest earnings\").\n",
    "    * **`generate_fixed_income_queries()`:** Creates queries related to fixed income instruments, incorporating companies and various bond types (e.g., \"Yield analysis for Amazon corporate bonds,\" \"Credit risk assessment of TSLA bonds\").\n",
    "    * **`generate_sector_queries()`:** Produces queries focused on market sector analysis (e.g., \"Technology sector performance last year,\" \"Growth projections for healthcare sector\").\n",
    "    * **`generate_unclassified_queries()`:** This is a crucial part. It includes a list of non-financial, \"out-of-scope\" queries (e.g., \"What's the weather forecast tomorrow?\", \"Recipe for chocolate chip cookies\"). These queries are vital for training a model to correctly identify when a user's intent *does not* fall into any of the predefined financial categories, thereby preventing misclassifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Dataset Assembly and Shuffling:**\n",
    "    * The `generate_dataset()` function calls each of the specific generation functions to create a collection of queries for each intended category.\n",
    "    * The generated queries are then combined into a single list.\n",
    "    * Crucially, `random.shuffle()` is used to randomize the order of the queries in the final dataset. This prevents any ordering bias if the dataset were to be used for training a model, ensuring that the model doesn't learn patterns based on the order in which intents appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **CSV Output:**\n",
    "    * The `save_to_csv()` function writes the generated dataset into a CSV file. Each row in the CSV contains two columns:\n",
    "        * `query`: The generated user query string.\n",
    "        * `expected_intent`: The predefined category or \"intent\" for that query (e.g., \"stock_analysis,\" \"quarterly_report_summary,\" \"unclassified\").\n",
    "    * A timestamp is incorporated into the filename (e.g., `financial_queries_20250711_042810.csv`) to ensure unique filenames for each run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Was Created:\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a CSV file named something like `financial_queries_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`. This file contains a dataset of 160 distinct queries, each meticulously labeled with its corresponding expected intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the dataset includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **40 Stock Analysis Queries:** Examples: \"Analyze Microsoft stock performance,\" \"AAPL stock forecast and price targets.\"\n",
    "* **35 Quarterly Report Summary Queries:** Examples: \"Summary of Amazon's last quarter report,\" \"Key metrics from NVDA's latest earnings.\"\n",
    "* **30 Fixed Income Analysis Queries:** Examples: \"Yield analysis for JPMorgan corporate bonds,\" \"Credit risk assessment of MSFT bonds.\"\n",
    "* **30 Sector Analysis Queries:** Examples: \"Technology sector performance this year,\" \"Growth projections for healthcare sector.\"\n",
    "* **25 Unclassified Queries:** Examples: \"Should I buy or rent a home?\", \"Recipe for chocolate chip cookies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured and labeled dataset serves as a foundational resource for developing and evaluating NLU models tailored for financial domain understanding, ensuring that a system can accurately interpret user requests and provide relevant information."
